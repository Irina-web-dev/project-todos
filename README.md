# Project Todos

In this week's project I have built a Todos application by using Redux. 

## The problem

I started by sketching out what the app will look like, what features do I want to implement and what components do I need. 

Once the sketch was ready I created components I would need, set up the Redux store and connected it to the App.js. This time I decided to do part of the styling in the begining. And for that I used styled components, which I find a very convenient and handy way to apply styling. The app is created with mobile-first approach and I am using media queries for tablet and desktop view.

The most difficult part of this project was to understand how useDispatch works and how to properly build and call actions. However, after we had done the first action together with the code coach, I was able to apply the same pattern to the other actions like toggleCompleteAll, addTask and deleteTask.

I am extra proud of a progress bar and lottie animation I did. I am using animation to handle empty state and show it when there is no task added. Solution on the progress bar I found by looking at other people code, and a watched couple of tutorials about how to use lottie animation files. At the end I also created customized checkbox.

If I had more time I would have created a possibility to set a due date on a task and to filter completed/uncompleted tasks.
